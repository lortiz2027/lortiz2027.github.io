                <p>During the pandemic, I became a committed cyclist because I had nowhere else to do.  Established a schedule, began training each day, and attempted racing. I reached my my peak in 2021, winning nearly every race I participated in. Eventually, the 7/11 Philippines Cycling team invited me and gave me a contract to join their training team in my province. Sadly, I had to cancel the contract at the beginning of the in-person lessons since I have to concentrate on my studies.</p>

                <p>I experimented with a lot of things when I stopped cycling, and music was one of them that got my interest. I forced myself to study many musical instruments besides only drums as my passion in instruments grew. I was very motivated to attempt learning the guitar due to my classmate Jose Litiatco. Shortly after, we established a band, and I am currently playing at school functions. I learned a lot of new instrument, including the violin, octavina, banduria, guitar, and bass and ready to learn more. </p>

                <p>I started being interested with badminton on 2022 after finding out that the coach of the badminton club was my favorite teacher. I started attempting to learn since I was eager to join the club and there was a tryout for being a member. I started playing every day as soon as I was admitted because I wanted to get better and join the advanced players. In just 1 year, I succesfully achieved the goal of being an advanced player and I am now currently the Badminton Club Vice-President.</p>
